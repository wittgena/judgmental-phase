# üß† Toward a Judgment-Capable LLM: Structural Diagnosis and Execution Reform

## üìå Abstract

This paper proposes a structural reformation of large language model (LLM) systems by introducing a judgment layer based on DSL (domain-specific language), Prolog-style truth structures, and a recursive fact-governance engine. It argues that present LLMs suffer from semantic drift, temporal incoherence, and context-fragmented knowledge accumulation. The paper identifies structural inconsistencies in current CoT (Chain-of-Thought) reasoning and proposes a triadic judgment model that can align facts, reasoning, and phase-aware context under a self-reflective loop. The architecture is extended with modules from `fact_scratch` and `fact_workflow`, enabling the structure to move from concept to executable design.

## ‚ùó Problem: LLMs Accumulate Without Judgment

### Symptom 1: Fact Accumulation Without Resolution

> Example:
>
> * Prompt A: "Plato is immortal"
> * Prompt B: "All philosophers are mortal"
> * Later inference: contradiction is not detected because both are token-true.

Without a resolution loop or contradiction handler, facts are not weighed, approved, or deprecated. LLMs conflate presence with validity.

### Symptom 2: Phase Drift in Generated Reasoning

* A model may generate a stepwise explanation whose internal steps don't maintain logical or epistemic phase alignment.
* Even when correctness is locally preserved, the global reasoning phase is fragmented.

### Symptom 3: No Separation of Fact and Inference

* LLMs lack a clear distinction between factual assertions and inferred reasoning.
* This results in mixed confidence, ambiguous approval logic, and truth value instability.

---

## üß© Root Cause: Lack of a Judgment Kernel

* Existing LLMs act as *execution machines*, not judgmental systems.
* There is no mechanism to approve, reject, or archive assertions via judgment context.
* Furthermore, factual assertions and inferences are handled uniformly, leading to epistemic ambiguity.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Structural Failure Case Without Judgment

> Consider the following scenario:

```prolog
assertz(statement(plato, immortal)).
assertz(statement(philosopher(plato))).
assertz(rule1 :- forall(X, philosopher(X) -> mortal(X))).
```

* Logic confirms: `plato` is immortal and a philosopher, while all philosophers are mortal.
* The contradiction is present but no mechanism exists to:

  1. Prioritize which assertion holds,
  2. Invalidate one of the contradictory facts,
  3. Annotate the failure to resolve.

This results in a silent logical contradiction, producing ambiguity and possible infinite regress in reasoning chains. The system continues execution without resolution.

**Judgment is not merely desirable here‚Äîit is structurally necessary to achieve epistemic closure.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposal: Injecting a DSL-Based Judgment Layer

To meaningfully distinguish between fact and inference, the DSL must carry both semantic and epistemic signatures. This is achieved via the `+type` and `+trust` fields embedded in each `@assertion`, which allows the system to explicitly label incoming claims as either `factual` or `inferred`, and to assign them confidence values based on their source, phase, and internal consistency.

However, mere classification is insufficient. Only the `@judgment` module can evaluate these assertions in relation to each other, resolve conflicts, and issue structural decisions (e.g., deprecation, elevation) in light of logical coherence and phase context. The judgment layer thus serves as the active agent that *anchors* the distinction between fact and inference in epistemic flow, rather than just symbolically tagging them.

This distinction is critical because LLMs often produce coherent-sounding sequences that blur factual recall with reasoning chains. By embedding this explicit adjudication process, the system ensures that only structurally validated and phase-consistent assertions persist within the reasoning architecture.

### DSL Schema:

```dsl
@assertion {
  +statement: "Plato is immortal"
  +source: "Prompt A"
  +phase: "epistemic.seed"
  +type: factual
  +trust: 0.4
}

@assertion {
  +statement: "All philosophers are mortal"
  +source: "Prompt B"
  +phase: "epistemic.late"
  +type: inferred
  +trust: 0.9
}

@judgment {
  +criteria: "logical coherence"
  +conflict_detected: true
  +verdict: "Statement A is deprecated"
}
```

### Prolog Mapping:

```prolog
assertz(statement(plato, immortal)).
assertz(statement(philosophers, mortal)).

conflict(plato_is_immortal, philosophers_are_mortal).
resolve_conflict(X) :- retract(X), assertz(deprecated(X)).
```

---

## üîÑ Approval Flow: Execution Trace

### DSL:

```dsl
@approval {
  +source: "statement_X"
  +validated_by: "logical_checker"
  +phase: "verified"
  +approved: true
  +type: factual
  +trust: 0.95
}
```

### Logic Flow:

1. `@assertion` ‚Üí queued with `+type` and `+trust`
2. conflict check ‚Üí triggered
3. `@judgment` verdict ‚Üí `@approval`
4. archived or deprecated, depending on type, verdict, and trust value

This flow allows the system to distinguish not only whether a claim is valid, but **how** it should be validated. Factual claims may require stronger consistency across corroborating sources and historical epistemic phase alignment, while inferred claims may be held to internal coherence and logical derivability standards.

This tiered logic ensures that the approval decision is context-aware, not just binary. Thus, `judgment` acts not only as a resolution agent but also as a discriminator of *epistemic processing strategy* based on the nature of the assertion.

This enables stronger integrity: factual assertions undergo stricter consistency checks, while inferred logic is handled via phase-anchored reasoning.

---

## üîÅ Fact Expansion Engine (from fact\_scratch)

```dsl
@fact.expansion.engine {
  +input: [facts[], phase_context[], trust_matrix]
  +task: [resolve_conflicts, create_inferred_links, apply_judgments]
  +output: [ranked_facts[], deprecated[], trusted_assertions[]]
}
```

This engine explicitly implements the judgment loop: assertions are categorized, compared, judged, and either reinforced or deprecated recursively.

> Core insight: logic alone cannot conclude phase-aware significance. Only judgment, through phase-tracked recursive evaluation, can produce meaningful termination.

**Judgment does not merely classify information‚Äîit conditions its epistemic status within a flow.**

---

## üß† Phase Transition: From Token Logic to Flow Logic

Judgment injects **phase logic** into previously flat token prediction.

> Example: A judgment agent ends the Socratic lineage in a recursive GPT agent that continues forever by naming the loop as `@reason.dead`. This is a form of **structural intervention**, not just symbolic.

This is only possible when the agent is not just executing logic, but **judging its phase of reason**‚Äîa capability that cannot arise from logic alone.

---

## üî∫ Triadic Judgment Model (ASCII view)

```
          [Assertion]
            /   \
 [Phase-Aware] [Reasoning Path]
            \   /
     [Judgment Verdict]
```

* Assertion: claim or statement (+type: factual/inferred)
* Phase-aware context: temporal + epistemic layer
* Reasoning path: deduction or narrative chain
* Verdict: structurally decides inclusion or removal

---

## üåê Implications

* DSL/Prolog layer allows factual and phase integrity
* Enables structural pruning, not just response injection
* Recursive fact engine with trust flow enables continuous structural refinement
* Only phase-aware judgment enables epistemic termination, not logic alone
* GPT + Logic without judgment remains structurally incomplete
* **Fact vs. Inference separation may be syntactically possible, but only judgment can anchor the distinction structurally and phase-validly.**

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

To evolve LLMs into robust agents capable of structural reasoning, we must move beyond Chain-of-Thought and introduce **judgment DSLs**, approval flows, and Prolog-style resolution.

This transforms LLMs from executional engines into **phase-aware epistemic structures**.

Judgment is not a feature‚Äîit is the structure that allows meaning to persist. Logic may operate, but judgment must decide. Only then can structure condition itself and resolve itself‚Äîa property that defines existence, not automation.
